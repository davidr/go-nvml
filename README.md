# NVML Bindings for Go [![API Documentation][godoc-svg]][godoc-url] [![MIT License][license-svg]][license-url]

## NOTE: This project was abandoned by the original author. The code was forked from https://github.com/davidr/go-nvml. I have begun adding minor functionality to it until such time as the official go bindings from Nvidia are better documented etc.

This package provides bindings to Nvidia's NVML library using the bridge functionality and CGO.

## Usage

### Basic

```go
package main

import nvml "github.com/karlmutch/go-nvml"

```
